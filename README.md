# TaskCrafter

🛠️ **TaskCrafter** – A modern, hackable task scheduler for developers.
Think *cron*, but smarter: YAML-defined jobs, plugin support, chaining logic, and easy extensibility.

### 🚀 Why TaskCrafter?

- ✅ Write jobs in YAML (not spaghetti shell scripts)
- 🔁 Chain tasks with conditions: `after_success`, `on_fail`, `depends_on`
- 🧩 Extend with Python plugins or shell scripts
- 📦 Git-friendly (keep jobs versioned alongside code)
- 🪄 CLI-first, DevOps-inspired

> Automate backups, notifications, scraping, dev tasks, server jobs... all in one place.
