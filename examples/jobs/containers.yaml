# This is an example of jobs running using the container plugin
# The process is:
# 1. we create a file using binary plugin (without a container)
#    since the hello_from_container depends_on the create_file
#    it will wait for the file to be created
# 2. we use the alpine:latest container and map the volumes
#     - /tmp/configs:/app/configs means we map the directory in which
#       the file was created to /app/configs in the container
# 3. within the container, we execute some commands, then
#    we read the file to see if it was mapped properly
#    and we append a text string to the exact same file
# 4. note that we added the privileged parameter to the container
#    otherwise we couldnt access the host's /tmp directory
# 5. jobs result_from_file and result_from_result are executed after
#     - result_from_file will again read the file and echo the contents
#     - result_from_result will echo the result of the hello_from_container
#       which is the full output of the command we've entered (everything
#       that went to the stdout)
